Concerns:
  1. Security - Security concerns are of the highest priority because normally, they're not unit tested thoroughly and accessing
     someone's private repos with incorrect authentication would jeopardize all of github and lose customers' trust.
  2. Availability - We want to know that all of our service offerings are available to customers and that commits/deployments did
     not alter feature availability.
  3. Features working properly - Feature testing is deprecated when performaing API testing as API testing is mainly concerned
     with API availability and proper authentication. In case feature testing is not covered elsewhere (unit/integration), 
     then feature testing can be performed at the API level as well.
